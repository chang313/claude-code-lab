## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- Spec builds on existing social follow system (feature 007) — mutual follower computation derives from the existing `follows` table.
- Notification is poll-based (not real-time push) per assumptions — this is clearly scoped.
- Sent recommendation history (User Story 4) is P3 — can be deferred without affecting core feature.
