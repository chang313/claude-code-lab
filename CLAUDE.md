# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

This is a new project (`claude-code-lab`). No build system, dependencies, or source code have been added yet. Update this file as the project takes shape.

## Claude Code Guide Usage

The claude-code-guide agent may sometimes give incorrect answers. When the user asks follow-up questions, refer to the markdown files from the official Claude Code documentation at https://code.claude.com/docs using curl to provide accurate answers. After that, use AskUserQuestion to quiz the user and guide them to try it hands-on.
